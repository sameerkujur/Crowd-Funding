# Crowd-Funding
I really had fun creating the "Crowd Funding" project, which can be used by non-profit organizations to raise funds for projects and distribute them even more fairly and without any corruption. I created a smart contract using Solidity that supports the following features: -If more than 50% of donors approve a withdrawal, then only the NGO owner is allowed to withdraw money. -Donors have the right to check how their funds are spent. -If the target amount is not received within the set period, then the remaining money will be automatically reimbursed to the respective donors.
